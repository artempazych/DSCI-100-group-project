# Fraud Prediction in External Auditing

This project aims to predict the risk of fraud in external auditing using data science techniques. It involves building classification models to identify risky companies based on selected risk factors.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md`: Overview and guide to the project.
- `draft.ipynb`: R Markdown file containing the code and analysis for the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis:

1. Install R and the required packages: tidyverse, tidymodels, kknn.
2. Download the dataset (`trial.csv`) from the provided link.
3. Open the `draft.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Set the working directory to the location where the `trial.csv` file is saved.
5. Run the code chunks in the R Markdown file to perform the analysis.

**Note:** Basic knowledge of R and familiarity with data preprocessing, KNN classification, and model evaluation techniques are assumed.

## Results

The results of the analysis include the evaluation of the classifiers' accuracy, the optimal K value selected, and a comparison between the models. Confusion matrices provide insights into the performance of the models in predicting the risk of fraud.

For detailed code and analysis, refer to the `draft.ipynb` file.
